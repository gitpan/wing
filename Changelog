Changes from 0.10 to 0.11

Remove "Your orphaned session has been killed" message. Redirect
users back to login page instead.

Add confirmation of mailbox/directory deletion. Users can no longer
delete an entire mailbox with a single mouse click: we make sure that
they mean it.

Each time a client command is serviced by maild, ping the mailstream
to check it's still alive; if the ping fails, attempt to reconnect to
the IMAP server. This makes WING behave more gracefully when the IMAP
server connection times out. (RFC2060 guarantees a minimum timeout of
30 minutes, but we want a 90-minute timeout for inactive WING
sessions.)

Fix group reply so that original recipient (from "To:" header) is
included in "Cc:" of new message.

Fix cmd_reply so that Cc header is reset when it's not a group reply.
(Otherwise the Cc header may be populated with the value from a
cancelled group reply.)

Fix maild so that destination mailbox for copy/save is created when it
does not exist, by acting on a [TRYCREATE] message from the IMAP
server. maild looked for this message via the log callback, but
(certainly with recent c-client version) this is passed via a notify
callback.

Add per-port security options:
	REQUIRE_IP_CHECK
		Check that every connection originates from the same 
		client IP (protects against sniffing of WING session key);
	REQUIRE_COOKIES
		Do not put WING session key in the URL, force browser 
		to use cookies;
	SET_SECURE_COOKIE
		Add "secure" to cookie - prevents some browsers from
		sending the cookie over a non-SSL link.

Ensure that correct schema (http/https) and port are used when login
fails because user is already logged in or when login bypasses
frontend.

Fix header display when TABs are used after the colon instead of just
spaces. (RFC822 3.4.2 discourages TABs in headers but some software
uses it. Sigh.)

Fix save-to-nested-mailbox bug (which prepended cwd to *all* do_save
mailbox names instead of only newly-created ones typed into the form).

Tweak compose screen tabindex fields so that each header field tabs
straight on to its associated "Lookup" button where appropriate.

Change font size of search box from -2 to -1.

Add dynamic livelist support to Balance.pm.

Add extra fields to admin/stat and fix up handling of null values in
displayed tables.

Add admin/forward command to query a user's mail forwarding setting.

Fix is_legal_abook_name() and is_legal_alias() so that pure numeric
address book names/aliases are not allowed (they cause the SQL.pm
module to get confused about types and cause an SQL type-mismatch
error).



Changes from 0.9 to 0.10

Change all /wing-icons URLs to use $icon_prefix to allow icon images
to be pulled from a separate lightweight server and move the few Apache
icons (public domain ones) we were using into the same place.

Add support for bulk operations: copy/move/delete/undelete/flag of
message ranges (with all except the last accepting "flagged" as a
range).

Add support for mailbox searching (subject/message text/from/to).

Fix bug in maild when some headers (e.g. From and Cc) wrapped.

Fix maild to use rfc822_date from Mail::Cclient (requires version 1.1
or later) instead of calculating header itself (and failing to
calculate daylight savings time correctly).

Add support for group reply.

Add support for simple calendar display.

Add tabindex attributes to most HTML forms (Gervase Markham).

Fix typo when address book list order changed without user ever
setting any options before (John Dalbec).

Fix save/copy of message into a newly created mailbox: the mailbox
name should be created in the current directory that has been browsed
to instead of always the top level directory.



Changes from 0.8 to 0.9

Support https connections (for secure access) and port 81 connections
(to avoid the enforced proxying via multiple IP addresses done by
some ISPs).

Add explicit Date header to outgoing mail in maild otherwise a copy
saved in sent-mail won't have a Date header.

Fixed potential deadlock if /dev/urandom is unreadable.

Handle base64 and quoted-printable decoding transparently ourselves.

Send message/delivery-status MIME parts as text/plain since most
browsers don't know what to do with them.

Fold header continuation lines so that they don't get lost.

Add explicit action attributes to all <form> tags for the sake of
browsers which need them.



Changes from 0.7 to 0.8

Anonymised Oxford-specific stuff in Wing/Shared.pm for public release.



Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.7

Fixed numerous bugs in address books.

Support import of (Pine format) address books via browser upload.

Added per-user links files with folding view.

Added "portal" view.

A few bug fixes.



Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2

Changed abooklist separator to /:/ and changed address book help page
to remove ":" from list of legal address book name characters.



Changes from 0.5 to 0.5.1

Mailboxes screen was missing Help button.

maild failed to cope with messages without any sender: it bombed out of
list() and made client hang.

Removed remnants of address book debugging aids in maild.

Wing/Abook was allowing spaces in address book names but also using
space to separate the abooklist options field. Removed ":" from list
of legal abook name characters, made the field parser split on /[ :]/
and changed update_save to separate them with ":".
When all abooklist rows are updated, we can change that to /:/.

Attempting to create an address book with an illegal name now
includes the syntax rules in the error message.

Improved Wing/Admin "stat" command.



Changes from 0.4 to 0.5

Full address book support (including ACL controlled multiple books) added.

Added "du" and "finger" commands to Wing/Admin interface.

Message list says "To: ..." for outgoing messages.

Outgoing messages can be copied to the sent-mail mailbox.

Current mailbox can be exported in Berkeley format from
the "Manage" screen.

Message display screen default headers now include Cc rather than
Message-Id.

Cleanup of maild/httpd variable interaction: everything now
consistently uses maild_set/maild_get.

Button placing on the Compose screen has been changed.

Disk Usage screen summarises usage, quota and remaining space.

Icons for up and down arrow buttons have changed.

Off-by-one-pixel problem with GIF buttons tracked down to a
browser HTML rendering oddity and fixed.


Changes from 0.3 to 0.4

Clients are now less likely to hang if you hit "Stop".

base64 and quoted-printable MIME attachments are now displayed
even on browsers which don't handle the decoding themselves.
Additional HTTP headers are sent while displaying MIME attachments
to help browsers (as far as possible) to display them correctly.

Non-plaintext attachments are not now displayed in a newly-created
window even with browsers that support it: too many people were
confused by the extra window (or couldn't find it).

Client filenames are now URL-(en/de)coded automatically so, for
example, filenames with spaces appear properly instead of
containing "%20" sequences.

MIME attachments are uploaded correctly (before, attachments over
16K were corrupted). The MIME type of any uploaded attachment is
displayed in the "MIME Attachments" list. (Note: it is totally
dependent on what MIME type the client tells the server.)

Uploaded "Include" files are now placed before any sig indicator
line ("-- ") instead of right at the end of the current message body.

There is now a link to information on OUCS password policy from the
"Change password" screen.

The body of displayed mail messages is now escaped to avoid HTML any
HTML markup at all and anything that looks reasonably like an URL is
made into a hot link.

In the "Manage account" screen, cmd_manage wasn't initialising the
displayed versions of the forwarding address and vacation message
properly. They would appear correct immediately after the relevant
button was pressed but would appear blank on re-entry to the screen
(although the saved settings were stored and functioning correctly).

Successful logout forcibly expires session cookie to prevent future
failed logins from presenting stale cookie. When that happened, the
client saw a "bad session" error message instead of "login incorrect".

Removed stub "set address book search path" and "set bcc to self"
options in cmd_options.
