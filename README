DESCRIPTION

WING provides a gateway so that users can access email held on an
IMAP server via any web browser. Some features of WING are:

 * The browser does not need to support Java, JavaScript or frames
   but table and cookie support are preferable.
 * Users can create a hierarchy of multiple mailboxes and browse and
   move messages between them.
 * Messages with MIME attachments can be displayed nicely.
 * Per user defaults (such as screen size and mail signature) can be
   set and saved between sessions.
 * Files local to the client browser can be included in composed
   messages or MIME attached to them.
 * Arbitrary headers can be added to composed messages except that the
   "From:" header cannot be changed or forged for outgoing messages
   from WING.
 * WING is scalable up to thousands and tens of thousands of users.

WING 0.8 introduces the following features:
 * Users can import address books by uploading them via their browser
   (only Pine format address books supported in this version).
 * Users can create their own links (bookmarks), presented in a
   hierarchical list which can be folded/unfolded.
 * Users can login using a "portal" view which provides a frame down
   the left hand side of the browser containing site-configurable
   links along with their personal links. This is the only part of
   WING which requires frame support from the browser.

When integrated with a mail cluster similar to the one we have here
at Oxford University, WING also has these features:

 * Users can manage their account via the WING interface. This includes
   changing passwords, querying disk usage of mailboxes and disk quota
   an setting mail forwarding and "vacation" messages.
 * Users can create address books which can be browsed, searched and
   shared in an ACL controlled manner with chosen lists of other
   users and groups.
 * WING server nodes can be added or removed transparently and can be
   taken down for upgrades without affecting user service.
 * There are a few web-based admin tools for querying the status of
   the WING cluster and its users.


REQUIREMENTS

In its current state, WING requires many other pieces of software to
function. Future versions may be easier to install, configure and
maintain but this one requires the attention of an experienced system
administrator familiar with Apache/mod_perl, Perl and SQL databases.
It was also developed primarily for Linux. Although almost all of it
is portable, if you're running it on something other than Linux you'll
at least need to edit Wing/Login.pm and write a new version of
make_session_id() that gets cryptographically strongly random numbers
by some other means than simply reading /dev/urandom.
For configuring a mail cluster and its associated features, the
administrator will also need to know about network configuration,
firewalling, NFS, automount, named and exim. You have been warned.


AVAILABILITY

Wing is available from your favourite CPAN site as a tar ball or from
its home site in tar.gz form
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/perl/Wing-0.6.tar.gz
or source RPM form
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/SRPMS/wing-0.6-1.src.rpm
or "binary" (noarch) RPM form for Red Hat 5.x Linux
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/RPMS/noarch/wing-0.6-1.noarch.rpm


INSTALLATION

These instructions are probably woefully incomplete and inaccurate.
I'll assume there are three logically separate hosts: a frontend, an
IMAP server and a WING server. If necessary, those can all be the
same physical host (or there can be multiple hosts in each class).
If they are all the same host then WING will, in the current
configuration, still access user mailboxes by using loopback IMAP
connection to itself. It is possible to make WING access mail files
directly in this case but it needs changes to WING which I won't go
into here. Now start installing things:

On the frontend and the WING server install Apache, mod_perl,
Perl 5.004_04 (or later) and the following Perl modules:
  DBD-Pg
  DBI
  Data-Dumper
  Net-Telnet
  Apache-DBI
  MD5
  MIME-Base64
  Term-ReadKey
  HTML-Parser
  Term-ReadLine-Perl
  libnet
  IO-stringy
  CrackLib
  Mail-Cclient
  libwww
  MailTools
  MIME-tools
  Net-DNS
  SQL

Most of these are standard CPAN modules, a couple are modules
I've written but not officially released yet (CrakLib and SQL).
All are available in RPM form at
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/SRPMS/
for the source RPMs and
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/RPMS/i386
for binary RPMs built on Red Hat 5.x for x86. Those who can't cope
directly with RPMs will, for the moment, have to get rpm2cpio and
build them themselves. I will get around to releasing these modules
to CPAN sometime. SQL has bugs involving string/number quoting but
should work OK the way WING uses it.

On the frontend, install PostgreSQL. You may be able to use another
SQL database, but
 (1) it must support transactions (this rules out MySQL unless
     someone rewrites Wing::Login in a way which doesn't require
     transactions).
 (2) it must support using ident lookups for authentication (or else
     you will have to tweak the DBI connection setup).

Create a database for wing. I'll assume that Apache runs under the
username "httpd". Create database users "httpd" and "root". Note
that PostgreSQL user root really is root (uid 0) and *not* the
PostgreSQL "superuser" username (often "postgres"). 

Initialise the necessary database tables with the SQL from
    wing-init.sql (run as username httpd)
    abook-init.sql (run as username httpd)
    users-init.sql (run as username root)
Each user who wants to use wing should have a row in the users
table which includes their username, uid, gid and sender. The
"sender" field is what WING will put in the "From: " header of
outgoing messages that the user sends with WING. If using
PostgreSQL, after adding a number of users to the users table
don't forget to "vacuum analyze users" so that it realises it
should make use of index lookups. Also, give each user a personal
address book
    insert into abook_ids (username, tag) values ('fred', 'personal');

Start up the maild daemon under the httpd username. An appropriate
init.d boot time script is wing.init which can be copied to
/etc/rc.d/init.d/maild (or wherever you keep boot time scripts). If
you don't have a SysV flavoured boot configuration, tweak it yourself.

Install Wing. If you use the RPM, fine. If you're not you'll have to:
 * copy Wing.pm Outline.pm Wing/*.pm to your Perl site_perl directory
 * copy wing-icons/* to the wing-icons subdirectory of your Apache
   root directory
 * copy help/* to the wing-help subdirectory of your Apache root
 * install maild in /usr/sbin (or wherever your boot time script
   wants to find it)
 * create directories /var/lib/maild and /var/lib/maild/sessions,
   owned by httpd and mode 700.

Now the difficult part: edit .../site_perl/Wing/Shared.pm and go
through changing things to refer to your own hostnames, domains and
environment. Some things will need changing, most won't. The various
variables are reasonably well commented.

Edit your Apache httpd.conf and check you're running under user httpd
and group httpd. On the WING server only edit access.conf and add

  PerlModule Wing

  <Location /wing>
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Wing
  </Location>

  <Location /wing/login>
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Wing::Login
  </Location>

  Alias /wing-icons/ /home/httpd/wing-icons/

On the frontend, edit access.conf and add

  PerlModule Wing::Balance

  #
  # Using <Location /> below means the root directory of this web
  # server (or, typically, virtual host) brings up a login screen
  # for wing. This means users can just type a simple hostname into
  # their browser for wing access. If you don't want this and can't
  # spare a virtual host, change it to something like
  # <Location /wing-login> so that they have to type
  # http://foo.bar.baz/wing-login into their browsers to get at WING.
  #
  <Location />
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler Wing::Balance
  </Location>

  <Location /wing/admin>
  #
  # *** Add auth restrictions here to limit the people who can
  # *** use the admin interface to query wing.
  #
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Wing::Admin
  </Location>

Now create a file called /etc/wing.live on the frontend and put in
it, one per line, the hostnames of each WING server. You can comment
out lines by putting "#" at the beginning of the line.

Restart Apache on the frontend and WING server(s).

Right, that might just about be it. Try using a browser to
connect to http://yourfrontend.example.org/ (or .../wing-login
if you chose that Location above) and see what happens. If something
goes wrong, investigate and try to fix it. Don't mail me directly.
Some of the features (those above that I mentioned required the
extra cluster configuration) may not work. I don't yet have
instructions yet for how to set all that up but you can always look
at the source and figure it out for yourself if you're adventurous.

SUPPORT

There isn't any official support. Don't mail me directly. However,
I have set up a mailing list called "wing-admin" where I anticipate
those who want to set up WING can discuss things. I will monitor that
mailing list and help where I can but I'm not going to answer every
single little question, I'm not going to respond quickly (necessarily)
and I'm going to assume a good deal of sysadmin knowledge on the part
of participants. The list is a majordomo list. To subscribe, send the
following message *body* (the subject line is irrelevant and ignored)
    subscribe wing-admin
to majordomo@maillist.ox.ac.uk. To unsubscribe again send the message
body "unsubscribe wing-admin" to the same address. To send messages to
the list, mail to wing-admin@maillist.ox.ac.uk.

Good luck. You'll need it. It is rather good when it all works though.
