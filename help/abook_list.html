<h3>The table of address books</h3>
<ul>
<li>The table lists your own address books and any address books
belonging to other users which you have explicitly added. Address
books belonging to other users are listed in the form
"username/address_book_name".
<li>The <img src="/wing-icons/plus.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="+">
and
<img src="/wing-icons/minus.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="-">
markers indicate whether or not a given address book
is included in your default list of address books to search.
Click on the marker to toggle inclusion/exclusion.</li>
<li>Click on the
<img src="/wing-icons/arrow-up.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Up">
/
<img src="/wing-icons/arrow-down.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Down">
arrows to move the given address book up/down the ordered list.</li>
<li>Click on
<img src="/wing-icons/drop.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Drop">
to drop an address book owned by another user from the list.</li>
<li> Any of the above adjustments to the list take effect immediately
and last for the rest of the login session. Pressing the
"Update for future sessions" button saves the current list as the
default for all future sessions.
<li>Click on
<img src="/wing-icons/permissions.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Permissions">
to grant/revoke permissions for other users to access an address book
that you own.</li>
<li>Click on
<img src="/wing-icons/delete.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Delete">
to delete an address book that you own.
Note that there is no confirmation request and the data in a deleted
address book cannot be recovered. You cannot delete your original
"personal" address book.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating/adding address books to the list</h3>
<ul>
<li>To create a new address book, enter a name for it in the "Address book"
field and press the "Create/Add to list" button.
Address book names must be between 1 and 63 characters. Legal characters
are alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), spaces or those in the set
"!$%^*()+=;@~#?.,-" (quotes excluded).</li>
<li>To include an address book owned by another user in the above table,
enter its full name in the "Address book" field in the form
<tt>username/address_book_name</tt> and press the "Create/Add to list"
button. Note that the owner of the address book must have used the
above-mentioned "Permissions" button to grant you access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Short-cut for quick searches</h3>
From this page you can also perform a short-cut search for a given
alias by typing it into the "Quick search for alias" field and pressing
the "Search" button. The search is carried out for an exact match of the
alias in your default search list. It is equivalent to going to the
"Address Search" screen with "Search in" set to "default list" and the
condition fields set to "alias is ...".
