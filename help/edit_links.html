These are your personal links (like bookmarks). If you logged into
WING using the portal view, the "OK" button will make changes
immediately to the links that appear down the left hand
side of your browser. If you are not logged in with the portal view
then the "OK" button will return you to the Links screen so that you
can see the effect of your changes.

The <img src="/icons/back.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Back">
button takes you back to the Mail messages list (if you are using the
portal view) or to the Links screen (if not).
<p>
Each line entered will appear in the Links frame/screen as a "link",
preceded by a bullet, a plus or a minus. The plus or minus is used
to indicate lines which introduce sub-lists (those whose succeeding
lines are prefixed with an additional dot character). On the Links
frame/screen the plus/minus characters are hot links which
expand/collapse the associated sub-list.
<p>
When typing in link lines: each line can have an
optional description followed by an optional URL (don't forget the
leading tag such as <tt>http://</tt>). If the line is a sub-entry
in a higher-level list, prefix the line with one more dot character
than the parent has. See the example above for how this looks.
<p>
A line consisting of a single "-" character produces a horizontal rule
across the links frame/screen.
You can also simply include raw HTML as a link by making sure the
line starts with an HTML tag &lt;...&gt;.
<p>
Advanced users familiar with HTML may wish to know that a leading
"=" can be used to start a line which is included verbatim, without
even the surrounding table row/column tags. If you use this, you'll
want to include table row/columns tags of your own or end and
restart the table environment with &lt;/table&gt;...&lt;table&gt;
or else the browser may well render your HTML outside the links table.
