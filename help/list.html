<ul>
<li>Clicking on a message subject displays it</li>
<li> Letters to the left of each line indicate when the message
is tagged as (N)ew, (O)ld, (D)eleted or (F)lagged. Messages tagged
as (D)eleted are not actually purged until the <tt>Purge</tt> button is
pressed. Until that time, they can be untagged by using the (U)ndelete
short cut (q.v.) or by displaying the message and using the <tt>Undelete</tt>
button on that screen. Messages which are (F)lagged are those which are
found to match a search, via the "Search" screen or the "Quick Search"
field (q.v.), or have been flagged by the bulk operations drop down list
(q.v.).
<li>The letters to the right of each message are short cuts
for (S)ave, (R)eply, (F)orward and (D)elete/(U)ndelete. Those functions
are also available by displaying the message and using the correspondingly
named buttons on that screen.</li>
<li>The upward and downward pointing arrows (or the words <tt>Prev</tt> and
<tt>Next</tt>) take you to, respectively, the previous and next screenful of
messages. You can configure how many message count as one screenful
by using the <tt>Options</tt> button. The <tt>Top</tt> and <tt>Bottom</tt> buttons take you
directly to the top or bottom of the mailbox. If you are already at the
top or bottom of the mailbox, the unnecesssary buttons are greyed out
or not displayed at all.</li>
<li>The <tt>Compose</tt> button takes you to the message composition screen
where you can compose and send new messages.</li>
<li>The <tt>Mailboxes</tt> button takes you to a screen where you can select
a different mailbox to view or create, rename or delete mailboxes and
directories.</li>
<li>The <tt>Manage</tt> button takes you to a screen where you can manage your
account: display your disk quota and disk usage, change your password,
set mail forwarding or change and activate/deactiveate a vacation
message.</li>
<li>The <tt>Options</tt> button lets you configure various options for either
the current session or for every future session too.</li>
<li>The <tt>Purge</tt> button deletes from your mailbox all messages that are
tagged as (D)eleted. Once purged, messages <em>cannot</em> be recovered.
Once messages have been tagged as deleted, pressing the <tt>Purge</tt> button
deletes them all immediately-there is no further confirmation dialog.
</li>
<li>The <tt>Address Books</tt> button takes you to a screen where you can
create, browse, search, update and share your address books.
</li>
<li>The <tt>Logout</tt> button brings up a confirmation screen which lets you
then logout of your mail session. You <em>must</em> remember to logout
when you have finished your session.</li>
<li>The <tt>Search</tt> button brings up a screen on which you can
search for and flag those messages in the current mailbox which contain
your choice of words in a given header or the entire message text.</li>
<li>The <tt>Calendar</tt> button brings up a screen with a calendar of
the previous/current/next months displayed along with today's date. You
can also choose other months to display.
</li>
<li>The drop down listbox (which initially contains the command
"Search mailbox") and the input field to the right of it allow you to
do a "Quick Search" of the current mailbox or to do various bulk
operations.
<p>With the command "Search mailbox" displayed (as it is by default),
you can type a word into the input field and press the "Go" button to
search for messages containing that word. Messages which contain the
entered word anywhere in their entire message text (headers or body)
will be "Flagged" (marked with an "F" as described above). Pressing the
"Go" button without entering a word will unflag all messages.
<p>With the drop down box set to "Delete range", "Undelete range",
"Save range" or "Copy range" you can enter a numeric range of messages
and, on pressing "Go", the chosen operation will be carried out on
that range of messages. A range should be a comma-separated list of
"a-b" entries or else the word <strong><tt>flagged</tt></strong> to
refer to all those messages which are flagged. For example:
<dl>
<dt><strong><tt>10-20</tt></strong></dt>
<dd>Act on messages 10 to 20 (inclusive).</dd>
<dt><strong><tt>10-20,30-end</tt></strong>
<dd>Act on messages 10 to 20 (inclusive) and 30 and up (i.e. all messages
from number 30 onwards). You can also use "<strong><tt>last</tt></strong>"
or "<strong><tt>*</tt></strong>" instead of "<strong><tt>end</tt></strong>"
to mean the same thing.</dd>
<dt><strong><tt>flagged</tt></strong></dt>
<dd>Act on all messages which are flagged (i.e. have an "F" next to them).
You can abbreviate this word to the first letters of
<strong><tt>flagged</tt></strong> or <strong><tt>found</tt></strong>
to mean the same thing (e.g. "<strong><tt>fla</tt></strong>",
"<strong><tt>fou</tt></strong>" or simply "<strong><tt>f</tt></strong>").
</dd>
</dl>
<li>With the drop down box set to "Flag range" you can flag all
messages in a given numeric range. The special range specifier
<strong><tt>flagged</tt></strong> mentioned above would be meaningless
in this situation and is not allowed.</li>
</ul>
