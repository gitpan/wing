<ul>
<li>Click on a mailbox (indicated with the icon
<img src="/icons/dir.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle"
  alt="&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;">)
to make it your current mailbox. It will be opened and its messages
listed. Incoming mail is always delivered to the special mailbox
called "INBOX" (which cannot be deleted or renamed).</li>
<li>Click on a subdirectory (indicated with the icon
<img src="/wing-icons/right.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="[dir]">)
to open that subdirectory and see any mailboxes and subdirectories
within.</li>
<li>To rename a mailbox or subdirectory (including the possibility of
moving it elsewhere in the hierarchy) click the rename button next to
it. If you want to leave it in the same directory, type the desired
new name into the "New name" field which will have appeared and then
press the "Rename" button. (You can instead press the "Cancel" button
to abort the rename sequence.) If you want to rename the mailbox or
subdirectory into a different directory, then click directory names
until you find the desired directory and then type in the new name.</li>
<li>To create a new mailbox or subdirectory, choose "Create mailbox"
or "Create directory" as appropriate from the menu. Then type the
desired name into the "with name" field and press the "Create" button.
Mailbox and directory names may contain any character except "/". The
IMAP server will place some restriction on the length of the name and
of the whole path but those limits will allow any reasonable length
(e.g. hundreds of characters, not tens).</li>
<li>You can also enter the full pathname of a directory explicitly
in the "Directory" field and click on the "Open" button to take you
directly to a given directory. Separate elements of the path with
the "/" character. For example, <tt>private/foosoc/old</tt>. If
you also fill in the "Filter" field, then clicking Open opens the
directory but only shows those mailboxes and subdirectories whose name
matches the given filter pattern. You can use "*" to match any sequence
of zero or more characaters and "?" to match any single character. For
example, "*new*" will only show mailboxes and subdirectories of the
given directory which contain the characters "new" in their names.</li>
<li>To delete a mailbox or directory, click on the
<img src="/wing-icons/delete.gif" border=0 align="absmiddle" alt="Delete">
button next to its name. There will be no confirmation request.
Deleting a mailbox will delete all its contents which cannot then be
recovered. Deleting a subdirectory is only possible if it is empty
(i.e. contains no mailboxes or further subdirectories).</li>
</ul>
