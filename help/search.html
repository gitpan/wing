This screen lets you search through the current mailbox by looking
for words that appear in message headers (<strong>Subject</strong>,
<strong>From</strong> or <strong>To</strong>) or the entire
<strong>Message text</strong> (consisting of all the headers and the
body). Messages which match the text that you type are <em>Flagged</em>
--they appear in the message list screen with an "F" beside them. All
searching is done in a case insensitive way and a match is found if
the exact text you type appears in the appropriate place in a
message: there are no wildcards, pluses, minuses, fuzzy matching or
anything complicated like that. Just type the text you want to find.
<p>
There is a drop down list from which you can select three variations
of a basic search:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Only mark matching messages</strong></dt>
<dd>
This unflags all messages in the mailbox before starting the search.
</dd>
When the search is over, the only messages flagged are those which
matched your search conditions. This is sometimes called a "new" search.
<dt><strong>Restrict search to currently marked messages</strong></dt>
<dd>
With this variation chosen, only those messages already flagged will
be looked at at all. This lets you restrict a previous search even
further by only considering for matching those messages matching your
previous condition. This is sometimes called an "and" search.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Mark matching messages in addition to those currently marked</strong></dt>
<dd>
With this option, messages matching your search conditions will be
flagged, leaving any previously flagged messages with their flag
intact. This lets you add more messages to a previous search. This is
sometimes called an "or" search.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Once you press the <tt>Search</tt> button and the search is complete, you
are returned to the message list screen with found messsages
flagged with an "F". You can restrict or add messages by returning
to the "Search" screen and choosing a "Restrict..." or "Mark ... in
addition" search type.
<p>
On the message list screen you can also do bulk operations (delete,
save, copy) on those flagged messages by using the drop down list box
on the top right of that screen.
